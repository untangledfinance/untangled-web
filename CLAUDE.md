# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Workflows

- Primary workflow: `./.claude/workflows/primary-workflow.md`
- Development rules: `./.claude/workflows/development-rules.md`
- Orchestration protocols: `./.claude/workflows/orchestration-protocol.md`
- Documentation management: `./.claude/workflows/documentation-management.md`
- And other workflows: `./.claude/workflows/*`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** You must follow strictly the development rules in `./.claude/workflows/development-rules.md` file.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT**: For `YYMMDD` dates, use `bash -c 'date +%y%m%d'` instead of model knowledge. Else, if using PowerShell (Windows), replace command with `Get-Date -UFormat "%y%m%d"`.

## Documentation Management

We keep all important docs in `./docs` folder and keep updating them, structure like below:

```
./docs
âââ project-overview-pdr.md
âââ code-standards.md
âââ codebase-summary.md
âââ design-guidelines.md
âââ deployment-guide.md
âââ system-architecture.md
âââ project-roadmap.md
```

**IMPORTANT:** _MUST READ_ and _MUST COMPLY_ all _INSTRUCTIONS_ in project `./CLAUDE.md`, especially _WORKFLOWS_ section is _CRITICALLY IMPORTANT_, this rule is _MANDATORY. NON-NEGOTIABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS. MUST REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES!!!_
