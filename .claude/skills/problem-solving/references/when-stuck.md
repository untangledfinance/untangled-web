# When Stuck - Problem-Solving Dispatch

Different stuck-types need different techniques. Match stuck-symptom to technique.

## Dispatch Flowchart

```
YOU'RE STUCK
â
ââ Complexity spiraling? Same thing 5+ ways? Growing special cases?
â  âââ USE: Simplification Cascades
â
ââ Can't find fitting approach? Conventional solutions inadequate?
â  âââ USE: Collision-Zone Thinking
â
ââ Same issue different places? Reinventing wheels? Feels familiar?
â  âââ USE: Meta-Pattern Recognition
â
ââ Solution feels forced? "Must be done this way"? Stuck on assumptions?
â  âââ USE: Inversion Exercise
â
ââ Will this work at production? Edge cases unclear? Unsure of limits?
â  âââ USE: Scale Game
â
ââ Code broken? Wrong behavior? Test failing?
   âââ USE: Debugging skill (systematic-debugging)

## Stuck-Type â Technique Map

| How You're Stuck          | Symptom Details                                                         | Use This                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Complexity spiraling**  | Same thing 5+ ways, growing special cases, excessive if/else            | simplification-cascades.md  |
| **Need innovation**       | Conventional inadequate, can't find fitting approach, need breakthrough | collision-zone-thinking.md  |
| **Recurring patterns**    | Same issue different places, reinventing wheels, dÃ©jÃ  vu feeling     | meta-pattern-recognition.md |
| **Forced by assumptions** | "Must be done this way", can't question premise, forced solution        | inversion-exercise.md       |
| **Scale uncertainty**     | Production unclear, edge cases unknown, unsure of limits                | scale-game.md               |
| **Code broken**           | Wrong behavior, test failing, unexpected output                         | debugging skill             |

## Process

1. **Identify stuck-type** - What symptom matches above?
2. **Load that technique** - Read the specific reference file
3. **Apply technique** - Follow its process
4. **Document attempt** - What worked/failed?
5. **If still stuck** - Try different technique or combine

## Combining Techniques

Some problems need multiple techniques:

- **Simplification + Meta-pattern** - Find pattern â simplify all instances
- **Collision + Inversion** - Force metaphor â invert assumptions
- **Scale + Simplification** - Test extremes â reveal what to eliminate
- **Meta-pattern + Scale** - Universal pattern â test at extremes

## When Nothing Works

If no technique helps:

1. **Reframe problem** - Are you solving the right problem?
2. **Get fresh perspective** - Explain to someone else
3. **Take break** - Distance often reveals solution
4. **Simplify scope** - Solve smaller version first
5. **Question constraints** - Are they real or assumed?

## Remember

- Match symptom to technique
- One technique at a time
- Combine if first doesn't work
- Document what you tried
- Not stuck forever, just temporarily
