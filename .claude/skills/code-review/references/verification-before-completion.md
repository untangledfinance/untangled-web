# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim                 | Requires                        | Not Sufficient                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Tests pass            | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass"    |
| Linter clean          | Linter output: 0 errors         | Partial check, extrapolation   |
| Build succeeds        | Build command: exit 0           | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed             | Test original symptom: passes   | Code changed, assumed fixed    |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified        | Test passes once               |
| Agent completed       | VCS diff shows changes          | Agent reports "success"        |
| Requirements met      | Line-by-line checklist          | Tests passing                  |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse                                  | Reality                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "Should work now"                       | RUN the verification   |
| "I'm confident"                         | Confidence â  evidence |
| "Just this once"                        | No exceptions          |
| "Linter passed"                         | Linter â  compiler     |
| "Agent said success"                    | Verify independently   |
| "I'm tired"                             | Exhaustion â  excuse   |
| "Partial check is enough"               | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter     |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**

```
â [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
â "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**

```
â Write â Run (pass) â Revert fix â Run (MUST FAIL) â Restore â Run (pass)
â "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**

```
â [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
â "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**

```
â Re-read plan â Create checklist â Verify each â Report gaps or completion
â "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**

```
â Agent reports success â Check VCS diff â Verify changes â Report actual state
â Trust agent report
```

## Why This Matters

From 24 failure memories:

- your human partner said "I don't believe you" - trust broken
- Undefined functions shipped - would crash
- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion â redirect â rework
- Violates: "Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced."

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**

- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

**Rule applies to:**

- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.
